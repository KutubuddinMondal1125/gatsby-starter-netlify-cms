A cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with equal parts double espresso, steamed milk, and steamed milk foam on top. Cream may be used instead of milk. It is typically smaller in volume than a latte, and has a thicker layer of microfoam. Espresso is typically made with a dark roasted coffee and ground finely.

In Italian, cappuccino means "little cap," which aptly describes the head of foamed milk that sits atop the drink's espresso base. According to history, it also allegedly derives from the dress of the Capuchin order of monks. With their iconic brown hooded cowls and shaved heads, Capuchin monks are a pretty close human resemblance to the ring of crema and white foam that tops the classic beverage.

Microfoam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so small and numerous that they are unseen, but make the milk lighter and thicker. When the espresso is poured correctly, the microfoam will remain partly on top of the mug, as well as mix well with the rest of the cappuccino.

Cappuccinos are usually made using an espresso machine. The double espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine's steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam, which can be decorated with art made with the same milk, or simply sprinkled with cinnamon or cocoa powder.
